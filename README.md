## Project Status
This project is currently under development, and certain features are yet to be implemented. 

### Pending Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing.
- [ ] Write feature files with Gherkin syntax to describe test scenarios.
- [ ] Create step definitions to automate tests using Selenium WebDriver.

Note: The implementation of Cucumber for BDD testing is planned and will be added in future iterations of the project. Meanwhile, testing is being conducted on StandAlone Scripts that are developed
